 **GAN for Fashion MNIST Clothing Image Generation**

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow to generate synthetic clothing images based on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The GAN is trained to learn the distribution of the dataset and generate realistic-looking images of clothing items, such as T-shirts, shoes, dresses, and more.


Key Components:

1. Generator: A neural network that generates images from random noise.
2. Discriminator: A neural network that distinguishes between real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator.
3. Adversarial Training: The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously; the generator improves to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator improves to correctly identify real vs. fake images.
Dataset
4. The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items, along with 10 classes (such as T-shirts, sneakers, and bags). You can find more details and download the dataset here:
